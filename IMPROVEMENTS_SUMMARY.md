# Per-Transaction Insights & Subscription Updates - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've enhanced the Smart Financial Coach to generate insights and detect subscription changes on a **per-transaction basis** rather than only during bulk operations. This makes the system much more responsive and provides immediate feedback to users.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Per-Transaction Insights with Threading**

- **New Function**: `generate_transaction_insights()` in `insights.py`
- **Insight Types Added**:
  - `expense_spike`: Detects unusually large expenses in a category
  - `merchant_spike`: Detects higher than usual spending at a specific merchant
  - `daily_spend_high`: Alerts when daily spending exceeds average
  - `category_budget_alert`: Warns about high monthly spending in discretionary categories

### 2. **Threaded LLM Rewrites**

- **New Service**: `LLMService` in `services/llm_service.py`
- Uses `ThreadPoolExecutor` to parallelize LLM rewrite requests
- **Performance**: Multiple insights are rewritten simultaneously instead of sequentially
- **Auto-Applied**: LLM rewrites are automatically applied to both bulk and per-transaction insights

### 3. **Per-Transaction Subscription Detection**

- **New Service**: `transaction_subscription_service.py`
- **Smart Detection**:
  - Analyzes transaction patterns for the specific merchant
  - Detects new subscriptions as soon as 3 consistent payments are made
  - Identifies price changes and trial conversions
  - Updates existing subscriptions when amounts change

### 4. **Subscription Insights**

- **New Insight Types**:
  - `subscription_detected`: New subscription identified
  - `subscription_price_change`: Price increase/decrease detected
  - `trial_converted`: Free trial converted to paid subscription

### 5. **Enhanced Transaction Creation Endpoint**

- **Endpoint**: `POST /users/{user_id}/transactions`
- **Now Generates**:
  - Per-transaction insights with LLM rewrites
  - Subscription detection and updates
  - Subscription-related insights
- **Response**: Includes count of insights generated and subscription update status

### 6. **Improved Frontend Experience**

- **Real-time Feedback**: Users see immediate notifications about:
  - Number of insights generated
  - New subscriptions detected
  - Subscription price changes
- **Enhanced Insights Page**:
  - New filter options for all insight types
  - Visual badges for AI-enhanced insights
  - Clear indicators for different insight categories

## API Endpoints Added

### Insights

- `POST /insights/transaction/generate` - Generate insights for specific transaction
- `GET /users/{user_id}/transactions/{transaction_id}/insights` - List insights for transaction
- `POST /insights/transaction/subscription` - Check subscription impact of transaction

### Subscriptions

- `POST /subscriptions/transaction/check` - Check subscription impact of specific transaction

## Technical Benefits

### Performance

- **Threading**: LLM rewrites happen in parallel (3 concurrent workers by default)
- **Targeted Processing**: Only analyzes relevant data for each transaction
- **Efficient Queries**: Focused SQL queries instead of full table scans

### User Experience

- **Immediate Feedback**: Insights appear as soon as transactions are added
- **Smarter Notifications**: Context-aware messages about insights and subscriptions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: System gets smarter with each transaction

### Scalability

- **Incremental Processing**: Doesn't need to reprocess all historical data
- **Configurable Threading**: Can adjust worker count based on API load
- **Error Resilience**: Transaction creation still succeeds even if insights/subscriptions fail

## Example User Flow

1. **User adds transaction**: `$17.99 to Netflix`
2. **System detects**: This is the 3rd Netflix charge in ~30 day intervals
3. **Subscription identified**: Netflix $15.99/month subscription
4. **Price change detected**: 12.5% increase from $15.99 to $17.99
5. **Insights generated**:
   - "Netflix subscription detected: $15.99 monthly subscription"
   - "Netflix price increase: $17.99 vs usual $15.99 (+12.5% increase)"
6. **LLM Enhancement**: Both insights rewritten for friendlier tone in parallel
7. **User notification**: "Transaction added with 2 insights. Subscription price change detected for Netflix."
